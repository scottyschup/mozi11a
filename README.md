Lauren: Wouldn't it be fun to make a fake MDN entry generator?  
Scott:  OMFG yes. Let's do it. Now. I'll go get rnozilla.org. Shit that's taken. mozi11a.org it is.  
Lauren: Hahahaha

Fake entry ideas
================
* CSS selectors: :nth-kissing-cousins
* CSS functions: vertical-center()
* HTML elements: \<rl\> (random-order list)

To-do list
==========
- [ ] Make lots of funny fake entries
- [x] Get developer.mozi11a.org subdomain setup
- [x] Get this gh-pages hosted content to show up there (is this possible? __Yes.__)
- [ ] Copy MDN style to the pixel (or just good enough to trick really unobservant people)
- [ ] Laugh and laugh and laugh at how funny we are


More to come...
