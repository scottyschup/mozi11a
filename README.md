Lauren: Wouldn't it be fun to make a fake MDN entry generator?  
Scott:  OMFG yes. Let's do it. Now. I'll go get rnozilla.org. Shit that's taken. rnozi11a.org it is.  
Lauren: Hahahaha

Fake entry ideas
================
* CSS selectors: Kissing Cousins
* CSS functions: vertical-center()
* HTML elements: \<rl\> (random-order list)

To-do list
==========
* Make lots of funny fake entries
* Get developer.rnozi11a.org subdomain setup
* Get this gh-pages hosted content to show up there (is this possible?)
* Copy MDN style to the pixel (or just good enough to trick really unobservant people)
* Laugh and laugh and laugh at how funny we are


More to come...
